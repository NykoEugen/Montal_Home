# Montal Home

## Description
A Django web application for managing a furniture store with improved architecture, class-based views, and better development workflow.

## Quick Start (Locally)

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd Montal_Home
```

### 2. Install dependencies
It is recommended to use Python 3.11+ and a virtual environment:
```sh
make install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables:
```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
NOVA_POSHTA_API_KEY=your_novaposhta_key
```

### 4. Apply migrations and collect static files
```sh
make setupdb
```

### 5. Run the server
```sh
make run
```

## Running with Docker Compose

1. Make sure Docker and docker-compose are installed.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root (see above).
3. Run:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

- The app will be available at http://localhost:8000
- PgAdmin â€” http://localhost:5050 (email: admin@admin.com, password: admin)

## Development Commands

### Makefile Commands
- `make help` â€” show all available commands
- `make install` â€” install dependencies in virtual environment
- `make run` â€” start development server
- `make test` â€” run tests
- `make lint` â€” run code quality checks (isort, black, mypy)
- `make autofmt` â€” auto-format code
- `make clean` â€” clean up cache and temporary files
- `make migrate` â€” apply database migrations
- `make makemigrations` â€” create new migrations
- `make shell` â€” open Django shell
- `make collectstatic` â€” collect static files
- `make dev` â€” quick development setup (install + setupdb + run)

### Code Quality
```sh
make lint          # Run all code quality checks
make autofmt       # Auto-format code
make precommit     # Run pre-commit checks (format + lint + test)
```

### Database Operations
```sh
make makemigrations  # Create new migrations
make migrate         # Apply migrations
make setupdb         # Create and apply migrations
```

### Loading Data
```sh
# Load fixtures with custom command
python manage.py load_fixtures data.json

# Or use Django's built-in command
python manage.py loaddata data.json
```

## Project Structure Improvements

### ðŸ”§ **Refactoring Highlights**

1. **Class-Based Views**: Converted function-based views to class-based views for better organization and reusability
2. **Improved Models**: Added validation, properties, and better field definitions
3. **Enhanced Settings**: Added security settings, logging, caching, and better environment configuration
4. **Better Development Workflow**: Improved Makefile with comprehensive commands
5. **Database Access Fix**: Moved parameter creation from app initialization to post_migrate signals
6. **Code Quality**: Organized requirements.txt and added comprehensive linting tools

### **Key Features**
- âœ… Class-based views for better maintainability
- âœ… Enhanced security settings for production
- âœ… Improved error handling and validation
- âœ… Better development workflow with Makefile
- âœ… Comprehensive code quality tools
- âœ… Custom management commands
- âœ… Ukrainian localization support
- âœ… PostgreSQL support for production

## Tests
```sh
make test
```

## Production Deployment
```sh
make production  # Clean, collect static, and migrate
```
